In this project, I created a sign form.
I added client-side form validation to the input forms so that users can enter the correct data before the form is submitted.
I added pattern to password fields so that they will contain at least 1 lower case, 1 upper case, and 1 digit.
I used javascript to check that password fields match each other 
The link to the sign up form is: https://preciouskusi17.github.io/Sign-Up-Form/
